Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is a widely distributed species. In Europe and North America, it is found in both hardwood and conifer forests, as well as heathland, in summer and autumn.[46] In Mexico, it is common in coniferous forests.[47] It fruits from the ground or from decaying wood,[46] on burned areas in forests,[37] and is often found near fallen trees and tree stumps.[48] The fungus can also grow on woodchips used in gardening and landscaping, and so it also appears on roadsides and other locations where this material is used.[42] Fruit bodies occur singly to scattered, or in clusters,[36] and can be very abundant.[33] Generally considered a dry weather mushroom, it can be plentiful when other mushrooms are scarce.[37] Other locations where the false chanterelle has been recorded include Central and South America, northern Asia, Australia and New Zealand.[42] Populations in California represent a complex of undescribed species that are collectively referred to as Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca sensu lato.[36]

A saprophytic fungus, H. aurantiaca obtains nutrients from forest litter and decomposing wood,[43] causing a brown rot on the wood upon which it grows.[49]

H. aurantiaca secretes large amounts of oxalic acid, a reducing agent and relatively strong acid. This stimulates weathering of the humus layer of forest soil, and influences the solubility and turnover of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen), which in turn affects their availability for use by forest trees.[49]
