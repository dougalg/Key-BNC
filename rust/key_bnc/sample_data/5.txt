The false chanterelle has been described as edible (though not tasty) by some experts,[25][32][50] but other authors report it as potentially poisonous.[46][51] Indeed, Fries described it as venenatus, meaning "poisonous", in 1821.[6] David Arora speculates that the confusion about edibility may be a result of misidentification with the similar-looking but definitely poisonous Omphalotus species.[25] Some people experience gastrointestinal symptoms after eating the mushroom, possibly due to its high levels of the sugar alcohol arabitol.[52] It was eaten, though not especially highly regarded, by the Zapotec people of Ixtlán de Juárez in Oaxaca.[53] The Tepehuán people of northwestern Mexico also occasionally eat the mushroom, which they refer to in their native language as guin'xacan ("delightful") or kia's gio' ("iguana lard"); there, it is commonly prepared by roasting over charcoal, or boiling and garnishing with cheese.[54]
